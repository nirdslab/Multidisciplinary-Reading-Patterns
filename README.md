# Multidisciplinary Reading Patterns of Digital Documents

Multidisciplinary Reading Patterns is an eye-tracking dataset consisting of reading patterns of researchers on scientific literature.
In the initial version, we include reading patterns of seven doctoral students on two articles collected using a [PupilLabs Core](https://pupil-labs.com/products/core/) eye tracker.
The repository includes both raw data and processed data.

## Dataset

### Raw Data
Raw pupillary, fixation data after processing annotations are included in the `dataset/raw` folder in the format
`<participant-number>-<article>-<dataset-type>.csv`.
**Note:** Raw data does not include files generated by PupilLabs export tools.

### Processed Data
Dataset after being processed using [Real-Time Advanced Eye Movements Analysis Pipeline (RAEMAP)](https://doi.org/10.1145/3379157.3391992) is included in `dataset/processed` folder, with (1) Gaze data and (2) Pupil data.
